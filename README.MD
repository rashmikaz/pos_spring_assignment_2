This API is designed to manage the core functionalities of a Point-of-Sale (POS) system, such as managing customers, items, and orders. It is built using the Spring Framework and follows a RESTful architecture. The API provides customer management features, allowing users to add, update, delete, and retrieve customer information. It also includes item management capabilities, enabling the handling of inventory by adding, updating, and deleting items, as well as retrieving detailed information about them. Additionally, order management functionalities allow users to place orders, retrieve order details, and update item quantities after orders are processed.

The API endpoints are prefixed with "api/v1/". For customer-related operations, there are endpoints to add a new customer, get customer details by ID, update customer information, delete a customer, and retrieve all customers. Similarly, item-related endpoints allow adding new items, retrieving item details by ID, updating item information, deleting an item, and retrieving a list of all items. The order endpoints handle placing new orders, retrieving order details by ID, and listing all orders.

The API is developed using Spring, MySQL for database management, Hibernate (JPA) for object-relational mapping, Jackson for JSON request and response handling, and Maven for dependency management. It runs on Java version 21.
